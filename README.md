# Urban Life Optimizer
nwHacks 2026 Project
Author: Mu Ye, Sakura, Natalie, Annaliese

**Context**
People living in cities are getting increasingly burnt out by obligations such as work and commuting. Moving closer to work might seem nice, but often comes with a higher cost of living. The Urban Life Optimizer aims to help guide users by suggesting a balanced lifestyle that is both mentally and financially sustainable.

**Program Function**
The program output suggests how they should structure their life. For example, whether they should drive or transit for commute, or do a hybrid. It will also suggest whether they should continue to live where they are currently living, or move. If the program suggests moving, it also suggests neighbourhoods to move to and how they should commute, structure extracurriculars, whether they should buy a car (if they don't have one) or sell their car (if they have one).
